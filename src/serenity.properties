serenity.project.name = Serenity and Cucumber and JUnit
# You can also customize the names of the types of releases using the serenity.release.types property, e.g.
serenity.release.types=milestone, release, version

report.customfields.environment = ${environment}
report.customfields.ApplicationVersion = 1.2.3

# We can also access any system variables that Java has access to. \
# For example, we could include the name of the user who ran the test run with the ${USER} system variable
report.customfields.user = ${USER}

# Not all system properties are available to Java. For example, on Linux systems, \
# the $HOST variable gives the name of the local machine. \
# We could include this in our report by adding the following property:

report.customfields.host = ${HOST}

# By default, the fields will appear in an arbitrary order.\
# You can force the fields to appear in a pre-determined order using the report.customfields.order field:

report.customfields.order=ApplicationVersion,environment,user,host

# You can use Groovy expressions to access system properties (that you can pass in from the command line).
# The env property gives you access to the current environment variables.
#  For example, to display the current Jenkins build number, you could include the following line:
sysinfo.build = "${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
